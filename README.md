# Huawei-Project

This repository contains the complete Huawei IASC South Africa website developed during my WIL placement. The project features a multi-page responsive website built with modern web technologies including HTML5, CSS3 (with CSS Grid/Flexbox), and vanilla JavaScript. The site showcases Huawei's enterprise solutions and IASC's educational mission through interactive components, animations, and mobile-first responsive design.
